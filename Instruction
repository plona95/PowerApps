Hi, The purpose of this portfolio site is to prove my PowerApps proficiency. I cannot share the apps I made as I am not allowed to do so by my current empolyer, 
but I can share some details, screenshots and videos of the apps proving my previously mentioned skills. Thank you for your time and feel free to take look on the files
below and above!
